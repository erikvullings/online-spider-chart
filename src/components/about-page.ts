This online tool allows you to create a radar or spider chart based on Excel (tab-separated) data.

- â–  Copy and paste your Excel data: make sure the data contains a header row, and an ID column. The data range must be between 0 and 100. It may optionally also contain an info column.
- â–  Define your chart: specify the id and info columns, as well as the data columns.
- â–  Analyze your data

## Source code
